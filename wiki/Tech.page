Technical decisions
===================

The original author decided to use the strict version of Data.Text and
attoparsec for a couple of reasons that I am going to list here.

* Unicode: Since a lot of characters don't play nice with other encoding
(apostrophes, German characters) I had to got with the option that provided
support for them.

* Attoparsec: Related to the next point. The strict version of the text parser
provides partial results which is a nice when providing some control over when
to consume, also is more predictable.

* Strict: This is going to force the use of strict IO (avoiding lazy IO) or
conduits. This latter ones play particularly well with attoparsec partial input.
Also we can avoid some space leaks associated with lazy IO.

In the end I didn't use lazy text nor lazy attoparsec because subtitle files
normally are read from a hard-disk which is not a source of information where
laziness is valuable for its guaranties.
