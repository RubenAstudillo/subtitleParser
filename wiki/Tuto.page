Play a little bit
-----------------

I hope that the exposed API is simple enough so you can play with it a bit
without too much disconcert, my goal was to make it accessible. Either way I'll
analyze a example here

Before that we need to make sure that all the corresponding modules are
installed. If you have the haskell platform you should have the cabal program
installed, then is just a matter of

    cabal update
    cabal install subtitleParser

This will also install the corresponding dependencies as `Text` and `Attoparsec`.

### SRT

First thing you should do is to load the subtitles as `Text` then just apply the
function
    
    parseSRT text

To get the ADT descrived in the `SRT.Datatypes`. Pretty simple right?

### SUB

The same principle apply here with `SUB`. One should load the file and then

  parseSUB text

And we receive the correspond to the ones described in `SUB.Datatypes`
