Why bother
==========

This package is an answer to a homework I keep doing over and over again for
some little projects, so it made sense to me for it to be released so maybe
somebody could benefit.

Also I wanted to learn to use darcs (which you should try btw). I think there
isn't a better way to know well a dvcs as having a little pet project to mess
around with it.

The spirit of this package is that should prioritize readability over anything
else, also all patches are welcome
