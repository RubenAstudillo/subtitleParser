Welcome to Subtitle Parser Wiki!
================================

This package is a collection of parsers for the most common subtitles files on
the wild. It aims to be readable over performant. That doesn't mean it doesn't
offer some really good speed.

It expect to at least the following formats:

* SRT
* SUB
* ASS (Patches welcome!)

Each of them available as a haskell module on hackage under the name of subtitleParser
under the BSD license. Each module contains corresponding ADT, deconstruction functions
and parser. Give it a try! :-)
